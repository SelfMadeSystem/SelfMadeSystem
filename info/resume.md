#### [live-jsx-app](https://live-jsx-app.shoghisimon.ca)

A live JSX editor that allows you to write TypeScript and React code with Tailwind CSS v4.0 and see the result in real-time.

Requires no build step, no bundler, and no server. Just write JSX and see the result.

To my knowledge, this is the first live JSX editor with TypeScript and React support and instant preview.

Uses [swc](https://swc.rs) for transpilation, PostCSS for Tailwind CSS, and some funky browser finagling to make it all work. Actually rewrote [monaco-tailwindcss](https://github.com/remcohaszing/monaco-tailwindcss) for Tailwind CSS v4.0.

#### [shenanigans](https://shenanigans.shoghisimon.ca)

A collection of fun and interesting projects I've worked on. Includes fancy CSS and WebGL experiments, a 3D SVG renderer, and a few games. Pretty much any complicated effect that won't fit in uiverse.io goes here. Most of the effects are used in production grade websites. All are modular and highly customizable.
